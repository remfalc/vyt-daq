daq (0.3-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Fix FTBFS: update Build-Depends with flex, bison (Closes: #609054)
  * This version now supports inline mode since the dumbnet library is now properly 
    detected (Closes: #609865)
  * To fix the above change the debian/patches/10_dnet-to-dumbnet.diff patch
    New changes in the patch:
      - Make m4/sf.m4 work with latest autoconf since the AX_CFLAGS_GCC_OPTION
        call would not work when using multiple GCC_OPTIONS, only one option (pedantic)
        is now check to set 
     - os-daq-modules/Makefile.am, os-daq-modules/daq_ipq.c, os-daq-modules/daq_nfq.c:
        Modified to use 'dumbnet' instead of 'dnet'
     - README: it's 'aclocal -I m4', there is no 'config' directory
     - More changes due to the automatic regeneration of all autoconf files after doing the
       above changes and running:
       'libbtoolize --copy --force ; aclocal -I m4; autoheader; autoconf; automake --foreign '

daq (0.3-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Initial release. 
  * This library is required for Snort 2.9.0 (produced by the Snort team).
    Since I will be targetting experimental with Snort 2.9.0 I'm uploading this
    library there too.
  * debian/patches/10_dnet-to-dumbnet.diff: Patch to use dumbnet instead of
    dnet. It is not applied as it currently breaks the build due to an autoconf
    issue (to be investigated). This only prevents the IPQ and NFQ DAQs from
    being available (but the PCAP module should work)
